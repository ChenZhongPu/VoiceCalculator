![](icon.png)

This Android app is written by `Ruby` with the advantage of `RubyMotion`.

## Features

- Providing digit voice when clicking (in Mandarin)

- Concise UI coping from [Smartisan Calculator](http://www.smartisan.com/#/home)

## Test and Run

`RubyMotion` only supports `Mac OS X`.

After you download and install `RubyMotion`, it will download all the necessary Android SDK for you,

```
# run on the device (make sure the USB debugger is allowed)
$ rake device

# or run on the emulator (recommend Genymotion)
$ rake emulator
```

You can also download the current version at [Droplr](http://d.pr/f/1dLhW) or [Baidu](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1skm3Gw1).
